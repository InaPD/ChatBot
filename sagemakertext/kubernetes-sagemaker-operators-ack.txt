Latest SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes
This section is based on the latest version of SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes using AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK).
Important 
If you are currently using version v1.2.2 or below of the original SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes, we recommend migrating your resources to the latest SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes, the ACK service controller for Amazon SageMaker based on AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK). 
For information about the migration steps, see Migrate resources to the latest Operators. For answers to frequently asked questions regarding the end of support of the original version of SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes, see Announcing the End of Support of the Original Version of SageMaker Operator for Kubernetes
The latest version of SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes is based on AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK), a framework for building Kubernetes custom controllers where each controller communicates with an AWS service API. These controllers allow Kubernetes users to provision AWS resources like databases or message queues using the Kubernetes API.
Use the following steps to install and use ACK to train, tune, and deploy machine learning models with Amazon SageMaker.
