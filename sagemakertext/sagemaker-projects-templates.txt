MLOps Project Templates
An Amazon SageMaker project template automates the setup and implementation of MLOps for your projects. A SageMaker project template is an Service Catalog product that SageMaker makes available to Amazon SageMaker Studio users. These Service Catalog products are visible in your Service Catalog console after you enable permissions when you onboard or update Amazon SageMaker Studio. For information about enabling permissions to use SageMaker project templates, see SageMaker Studio Permissions Required to Use Projects. Use SageMaker project templates to create a project that is an end-to-end MLOps solution.
If you are an administrator, you can create custom project templates from scratch or modify one of the project templates provided by SageMaker. Studio users in your organization can use these custom project templates to create their projects.
