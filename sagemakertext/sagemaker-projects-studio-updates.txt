SageMaker Studio Permissions Required to Use Projects
Users can view SageMaker provided project templates and create projects with those templates when you grant Projects permissions for users. You can grant these permissions when you onboard or update Amazon SageMaker Studio. There are two permissions to grant.

Grant Projects permissions for the Studio administrator to permit the Studio administrator to view the SageMaker-provided templates in the Service Catalog console. The administrator can see what other Studio users create if you grant them permission to use SageMaker projects. The administrator can also view the AWS CloudFormation template that the SageMaker-provided project templates define in the Service Catalog console. For information about using the Service Catalog console, see What Is Service Catalog in the Service Catalog User Guide.
Allow Studio users who are configured to use the same execution role as the domain to create projects. This grants Studio users permission to use the SageMaker-provided project templates to create a project from within Studio.

Important* 
Do not manually create your roles. Always create roles through *Studio Settings using the steps described in the following procedure.
For users who use any role other than the domain's execution role to view and use SageMaker-provided project templates, you need to grant Projects permissions to the individual user profiles.
The following procedures show how to grant Projects permissions after you onboard to Studio. For more information about onboarding to Studio, see Onboard to Amazon SageMaker Domain.
To grant *Projects* permissions for the administrator and domain execution role users

Open the SageMaker console.
Choose Control Panel.
If you choose Quick setup to set up your SageMaker Domain, you have permissions to use project templates by default.

To confirm that your SageMaker Domain has active project template permissions:
