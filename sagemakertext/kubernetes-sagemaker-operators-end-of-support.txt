Warning* 
*Reminder: The following steps do not install the latest version of SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes. To install the new ACK-based SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes, see Latest SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes.
Prerequisites
This guide assumes that you have completed the following prerequisites: 
+ Installed the following tools on the client machine used to access your Kubernetes cluster: 
  + https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-kubectl.html Version 1.13 or later. Use a kubectl version that is within one minor version of your Amazon EKS cluster control plane. For example, a 1.13 kubectl client works with Kubernetes 1.13 and 1.14 clusters. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is not supported in versions earlier than 1.13. 
  + https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl Version 0.7.0 or later 
  + AWS CLI Version 1.16.232 or later 
  + (optional) Helm Version 3.0 or later 
  + aws-iam-authenticator 
+ Have IAM permissions to create roles and attach policies to roles. 
+ Created a Kubernetes cluster on which to run the operators. It should either be Kubernetes version 1.13 or 1.14. For automated cluster creation using eksctl, see Getting Started with eksctl. It takes 20 to 30 minutes to provision a cluster. 
Cluster-scoped deployment
Before you can deploy your operator using an IAM role, associate an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider with your role to authenticate with the IAM service. 
Create an OpenID Connect Provider for Your Cluster
The following instructions show how to create and associate an OIDC provider with your Amazon EKS cluster. 

Set the local CLUSTER_NAME and AWS_REGION environment variables as follows: 
```
Set the Region and cluster
export CLUSTERNAME=""
  export AWSREGION=""
```
Use the following command to associate the OIDC provider with your cluster. For more information, see Enabling IAM Roles for Service Accounts on your Cluster. 

eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME} \
      --region ${AWS_REGION} --approve

Your output should look like the following: 

[_]  eksctl version 0.10.1
  [_]  using region us-east-1
  [_]  IAM OpenID Connect provider is associated with cluster "my-cluster" in "us-east-1"


Now that the cluster has an OIDC identity provider, you can create a role and give a Kubernetes ServiceAccount permission to assume the role. 
Get the OIDC ID
To set up the ServiceAccount, obtain the OpenID Connect issuer URL using the following command: 

aws eks describe-cluster --name ${CLUSTER_NAME} --region ${AWS_REGION} \
      --query cluster.identity.oidc.issuer --output text

The command returns a URL like the following: 

https://oidc.eks.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/id/D48675832CA65BD10A532F597OIDCID

In this URL, the value D48675832CA65BD10A532F597OIDCID is the OIDC ID. The OIDC ID for your cluster is different. You need this OIDC ID value to create a role. 
If your output is None, it means that your client version is old. To work around this, run the following command: 

aws eks describe-cluster --region ${AWS_REGION} --query cluster --name ${CLUSTER_NAME} --output text | grep OIDC

The OIDC URL is returned as follows: 

OIDC https://oidc.eks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/id/D48675832CA65BD10A532F597OIDCID

Create an IAM Role

Create a file named trust.json and insert the following trust relationship code block into it. Be sure to replace all <OIDC ID>, <AWS account number>, and <EKS Cluster region> placeholders with values corresponding to your cluster. 

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<AWS account number>:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.<EKS Cluster region>.amazonaws.com/id/<OIDC ID>"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
        "Condition": {
          "StringEquals": {
            "oidc.eks.<EKS Cluster region>.amazonaws.com/id/<OIDC ID>:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com",
            "oidc.eks.<EKS Cluster region>.amazonaws.com/id/<OIDC ID>:sub": "system:serviceaccount:sagemaker-k8s-operator-system:sagemaker-k8s-operator-default"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }

Run the following command to create a role with the trust relationship defined in trust.json. This role enables the Amazon EKS cluster to get and refresh credentials from IAM. 

aws iam create-role --region ${AWS_REGION} --role-name <role name> --assume-role-policy-document file://trust.json --output=text

Your output should look like the following: 

ROLE    arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-role 2019-11-22T21:46:10Z    /       ABCDEFSFODNN7EXAMPLE   my-role
  ASSUMEROLEPOLICYDOCUMENT        2012-10-17
  STATEMENT       sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity   Allow
  STRINGEQUALS    sts.amazonaws.com       system:serviceaccount:sagemaker-k8s-operator-system:sagemaker-k8s-operator-default
  PRINCIPAL       arn:aws:iam::123456789012:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/id/

Take note of ROLE ARN; you pass this value to your operator. 

Attach the AmazonSageMakerFullAccess Policy to the Role
To give the role access to SageMaker, attach the AmazonSageMakerFullAccess policy. If you want to limit permissions to the operator, you can create your own custom policy and attach it. 
To attach AmazonSageMakerFullAccess, run the following command: 

aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name <role name>  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSageMakerFullAccess

The Kubernetes ServiceAccount sagemaker-k8s-operator-default should have AmazonSageMakerFullAccess permissions. Confirm this when you install the operator. 
Deploy the Operator
When deploying your operator, you can use either a YAML file or Helm charts. 
Deploy the Operator Using YAML
This is the simplest way to deploy your operators. The process is as follows: 

Download the installer script using the following command: 

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-operator-for-k8s/master/release/rolebased/installer.yaml

Edit the installer.yaml file to replace eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn. Replace the ARN here with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the OIDC-based role you’ve created. 
Use the following command to deploy the cluster: 

kubectl apply -f installer.yaml


Deploy the Operator Using Helm Charts
Use the provided Helm Chart to install the operator. 

Clone the Helm installer directory using the following command: 

git clone https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-operator-for-k8s.git

Navigate to the amazon-sagemaker-operator-for-k8s/hack/charts/installer folder. Edit the rolebased/values.yaml file, which includes high-level parameters for the chart. Replace the role ARN here with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the OIDC-based role you’ve created. 
Install the Helm Chart using the following command: 

kubectl create namespace sagemaker-k8s-operator-system
  helm install --namespace sagemaker-k8s-operator-system sagemaker-operator rolebased/

If you decide to install the operator into a namespace other than the one specified, you need to adjust the namespace defined in the IAM role trust.json file to match. 
After a moment, the chart is installed with a randomly generated name. Verify that the installation succeeded by running the following command: 

helm ls

Your output should look like the following: 

NAME                    NAMESPACE                       REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART                           APP VERSION
  sagemaker-operator      sagemaker-k8s-operator-system   1               2019-11-20 23:14:59.6777082 +0000 UTC   deployed        sagemaker-k8s-operator-0.1.0


Verify the operator deployment

You should be able to see the SageMaker Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for each operator deployed to your cluster by running the following command: 

kubectl get crd | grep sagemaker

Your output should look like the following: 

batchtransformjobs.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com         2019-11-20T17:12:34Z
  endpointconfigs.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com            2019-11-20T17:12:34Z
  hostingdeployments.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com         2019-11-20T17:12:34Z
  hyperparametertuningjobs.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com   2019-11-20T17:12:34Z
  models.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com                     2019-11-20T17:12:34Z
  trainingjobs.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com               2019-11-20T17:12:34Z

Ensure that the operator pod is running successfully. Use the following command to list all pods: 

kubectl -n sagemaker-k8s-operator-system get pods

You should see a pod named sagemaker-k8s-operator-controller-manager-***** in the namespace sagemaker-k8s-operator-system as follows: 

NAME                                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  sagemaker-k8s-operator-controller-manager-12345678-r8abc     2/2     Running   0          23s


Namespace-scoped deployment
You have the option to install your operator within the scope of an individual Kubernetes namespace. In this mode, the controller only monitors and reconciles resources with SageMaker if the resources are created within that namespace. This allows for finer-grained control over which controller is managing which resources. This is useful for deploying to multiple AWS accounts or controlling which users have access to particular jobs. 
This guide outlines how to install an operator into a particular, predefined namespace. To deploy a controller into a second namespace, follow the guide from beginning to end and change out the namespace in each step. 
Create an OpenID Connect Provider for Your Amazon EKS cluster
The following instructions show how to create and associate an OIDC provider with your Amazon EKS cluster. 

Set the local CLUSTER_NAME and AWS_REGION environment variables as follows: 
```
Set the region and cluster
export CLUSTERNAME=""
  export AWSREGION=""
```
Use the following command to associate the OIDC provider with your cluster. For more information, see Enabling IAM Roles for Service Accounts on your Cluster. 

  eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --cluster ${CLUSTER_NAME} \
        --region ${AWS_REGION} --approve

Your output should look like the following: 

  [_]  eksctl version 0.10.1
    [_]  using region us-east-1
    [_]  IAM OpenID Connect provider is associated with cluster "my-cluster" in "us-east-1"

Now that the cluster has an OIDC identity provider, create a role and give a Kubernetes ServiceAccount permission to assume the role. 

Get your OIDC ID
To set up the ServiceAccount, first obtain the OpenID Connect issuer URL using the following command: 

aws eks describe-cluster --name ${CLUSTER_NAME} --region ${AWS_REGION} \
      --query cluster.identity.oidc.issuer --output text

The command returns a URL like the following: 

https://oidc.eks.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com/id/D48675832CA65BD10A532F597OIDCID

In this URL, the value D48675832CA65BD10A532F597OIDCID is the OIDC ID. The OIDC ID for your cluster will be different. You need this OIDC ID value to create a role. 
If your output is None, it means that your client version is old. To work around this, run the following command: 

aws eks describe-cluster --region ${AWS_REGION} --query cluster --name ${CLUSTER_NAME} --output text | grep OIDC

The OIDC URL is returned as follows: 

OIDC https://oidc.eks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/id/D48675832CA65BD10A532F597OIDCID

Create your IAM Role

Create a file named trust.json and insert the following trust relationship code block into it. Be sure to replace all <OIDC ID>, <AWS account number>, <EKS Cluster region>, and <Namespace> placeholders with values corresponding to your cluster. For the purposes of this guide, my-namespace is used for the <Namespace> value. 

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<AWS account number>:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.<EKS Cluster region>.amazonaws.com/id/<OIDC ID>"
        },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
        "Condition": {
          "StringEquals": {
            "oidc.eks.<EKS Cluster region>.amazonaws.com/id/<OIDC ID>:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com",
            "oidc.eks.<EKS Cluster region>.amazonaws.com/id/<OIDC ID>:sub": "system:serviceaccount:<Namespace>:sagemaker-k8s-operator-default"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }

Run the following command to create a role with the trust relationship defined in trust.json. This role enables the Amazon EKS cluster to get and refresh credentials from IAM. 

aws iam create-role --region ${AWS_REGION} --role-name <role name> --assume-role-policy-document file://trust.json --output=text

Your output should look like the following: 

ROLE    arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-role 2019-11-22T21:46:10Z    /       ABCDEFSFODNN7EXAMPLE   my-role
  ASSUMEROLEPOLICYDOCUMENT        2012-10-17
  STATEMENT       sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity   Allow
  STRINGEQUALS    sts.amazonaws.com       system:serviceaccount:my-namespace:sagemaker-k8s-operator-default
  PRINCIPAL       arn:aws:iam::123456789012:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/id/


Take note of ROLE ARN. You pass this value to your operator. 
Attach the AmazonSageMakerFullAccess Policy to your Role
To give the role access to SageMaker, attach the AmazonSageMakerFullAccess policy. If you want to limit permissions to the operator, you can create your own custom policy and attach it. 
To attach AmazonSageMakerFullAccess, run the following command: 

aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name <role name>  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSageMakerFullAccess

The Kubernetes ServiceAccount sagemaker-k8s-operator-default should have AmazonSageMakerFullAccess permissions. Confirm this when you install the operator. 
Deploy the Operator to Your Namespace
When deploying your operator, you can use either a YAML file or Helm charts. 
Deploy the Operator to Your Namespace Using YAML
There are two parts to deploying an operator within the scope of a namespace. The first is the set of CRDs that are installed at a cluster level. These resource definitions only need to be installed once per Kubernetes cluster. The second part is the operator permissions and deployment itself. 
If you have not already installed the CRDs into the cluster, apply the CRD installer YAML using the following command: 

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-operator-for-k8s/master/release/rolebased/namespaced/crd.yaml

To install the operator onto the cluster: 

Download the operator installer YAML using the following command: 

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-operator-for-k8s/master/release/rolebased/namespaced/operator.yaml

Update the installer YAML to place the resources into your specified namespace using the following command: 

sed -i -e 's/PLACEHOLDER-NAMESPACE/<YOUR NAMESPACE>/g' operator.yaml

Edit the operator.yaml file to place resources into your eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn. Replace the ARN here with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the OIDC-based role you’ve created. 
Use the following command to deploy the cluster: 

kubectl apply -f operator.yaml


Deploy the Operator to Your Namespace Using Helm Charts
There are two parts needed to deploy an operator within the scope of a namespace. The first is the set of CRDs that are installed at a cluster level. These resource definitions only need to be installed once per Kubernetes cluster. The second part is the operator permissions and deployment itself. When using helm charts you have to first create the namespace using kubectl. 

Clone the Helm installer directory using the following command: 

git clone https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-operator-for-k8s.git

Navigate to the amazon-sagemaker-operator-for-k8s/hack/charts/installer/namespaced folder. Edit the rolebased/values.yaml file, which includes high-level parameters for the chart. Replace the role ARN here with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the OIDC-based role you’ve created. 
Install the Helm Chart using the following command: 

helm install crds crd_chart/

Create the required namespace and install the operator using the following command: 

kubectl create namespace <namespace>
  helm install --n <namespace> op operator_chart/

After a moment, the chart is installed with the name sagemaker-operator. Verify that the installation succeeded by running the following command: 

helm ls

Your output should look like the following: 

NAME                    NAMESPACE                       REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART                           APP VERSION
  sagemaker-operator      my-namespace                    1               2019-11-20 23:14:59.6777082 +0000 UTC   deployed        sagemaker-k8s-operator-0.1.0


Verify the operator deployment to your namespace

You should be able to see the SageMaker Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for each operator deployed to your cluster by running the following command: 

kubectl get crd | grep sagemaker

Your output should look like the following: 

batchtransformjobs.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com         2019-11-20T17:12:34Z
  endpointconfigs.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com            2019-11-20T17:12:34Z
  hostingdeployments.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com         2019-11-20T17:12:34Z

  trainingjobs.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com               2019-11-20T17:12:34Z

Ensure that the operator pod is running successfully. Use the following command to list all pods: 

kubectl -n my-namespace get pods

You should see a pod named sagemaker-k8s-operator-controller-manager-***** in the namespace my-namespace as follows: 

NAME                                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  sagemaker-k8s-operator-controller-manager-12345678-r8abc     2/2     Running   0          23s


Install the SageMaker logs kubectl plugin
As part of the SageMaker Operators for Kubernetes, you can use the smlogs plugin for kubectl. This enables SageMaker CloudWatch logs to be streamed with kubectl. kubectl must be installed onto your PATH. The following commands place the binary in the sagemaker-k8s-bin directory in your home directory, and add that directory to your PATH. 
```
export os="linux"
wget https://amazon-sagemaker-operator-for-k8s-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/kubectl-smlogs-plugin/v1/${os}.amd64.tar.gz
  tar xvzf ${os}.amd64.tar.gz
# Move binaries to a directory in your homedir.
  mkdir ~/sagemaker-k8s-bin
  cp ./kubectl-smlogs.${os}.amd64/kubectl-smlogs ~/sagemaker-k8s-bin/.
# This line adds the binaries to your PATH in your .bashrc.
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/sagemaker-k8s-bin' >> ~/.bashrc
# Source your .bashrc to update environment variables:
  source ~/.bashrc
```
Use the following command to verify that the kubectl plugin is installed correctly: 

kubectl smlogs

If the kubectl plugin is installed correctly, your output should look like the following: 
```
View SageMaker logs via Kubernetes
Usage:
    smlogs [command]
Aliases:
    smlogs, SMLogs, Smlogs
Available Commands:
    BatchTransformJob       View BatchTransformJob logs via Kubernetes
    TrainingJob             View TrainingJob logs via Kubernetes
    help                    Help about any command
Flags:
    -h, --help   help for smlogs
Use "smlogs [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```
Clean up resources
To uninstall the operator from your cluster, you must first make sure to delete all SageMaker resources from the cluster. Failure to do so causes the operator delete operation to hang. Run the following commands to stop all jobs: 
```
Delete all SageMaker jobs from Kubernetes
kubectl delete --all --all-namespaces hyperparametertuningjob.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com
  kubectl delete --all --all-namespaces trainingjobs.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com
  kubectl delete --all --all-namespaces batchtransformjob.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com
  kubectl delete --all --all-namespaces hostingdeployment.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com
```
You should see output similar to the following: 
```
$ kubectl delete --all --all-namespaces trainingjobs.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com
  trainingjobs.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com "xgboost-mnist-from-for-s3" deleted
$ kubectl delete --all --all-namespaces hyperparametertuningjob.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com
  hyperparametertuningjob.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com "xgboost-mnist-hpo" deleted
$ kubectl delete --all --all-namespaces batchtransformjob.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com
  batchtransformjob.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com "xgboost-mnist" deleted
$ kubectl delete --all --all-namespaces hostingdeployment.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com
  hostingdeployment.sagemaker.aws.amazon.com "host-xgboost" deleted
```
After you delete all SageMaker jobs, see Delete operators to delete the operator from your cluster.

Check the job status by running the following: 

kubectl get <CRD Type> <job name>

If the job was created in SageMaker, you can use the following command to see the STATUS and the SageMaker Job Name: 

kubectl get <crd type> <job name>

You can use smlogs to find the cause of the issue using the following command: 

kubectl smlogs <crd type> <job name>

You can also use the describe command to get more details about the job using the following command. The output has an additional field that has more information about the status of the job. 

kubectl describe <crd type> <job name>

If the job was not created in SageMaker, then use the logs of the operator’s pod to find the cause of the issue as follows: 
```
$ kubectl get pods -A | grep sagemaker
  # Output:
  sagemaker-k8s-operator-system   sagemaker-k8s-operator-controller-manager-5cd7df4d74-wh22z   2/2     Running   0          3h33m
$ kubectl logs -p  -c manager -n sagemaker-k8s-operator-system
```

Deleting an Operator CRD
If deleting a job is not working, check if the operator is running. If the operator is not running, then you have to delete the finalizer using the following steps: 

In a new terminal, open the job in an editor using kubectl edit as follows: 

kubectl edit <crd type> <job name>

Edit the job to delete the finalizer by removing the following two lines from the file. Save the file and the job is be deleted. 
```
finalizers:

sagemaker-operator-finalizer
```
