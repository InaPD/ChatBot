AWS::SageMaker::Endpoint TrafficRoutingConfig
Defines the traffic routing strategy during an endpoint deployment to shift traffic from the old fleet to the new fleet.
Syntax
To declare this entity in your AWS CloudFormation template, use the following syntax:
JSON

{
  "[CanarySize](#cfn-sagemaker-endpoint-trafficroutingconfig-canarysize)" : CapacitySize,
  "[LinearStepSize](#cfn-sagemaker-endpoint-trafficroutingconfig-linearstepsize)" : CapacitySize,
  "[Type](#cfn-sagemaker-endpoint-trafficroutingconfig-type)" : String,
  "[WaitIntervalInSeconds](#cfn-sagemaker-endpoint-trafficroutingconfig-waitintervalinseconds)" : Integer
}

Properties
CanarySize 
Batch size for the first step to turn on traffic on the new endpoint fleet. Value must be less than or equal to 50% of the variant's total instance count. 
Required: No 
Type: CapacitySize 
Update requires: No interruption
LinearStepSize 
Batch size for each step to turn on traffic on the new endpoint fleet. Value must be 10-50% of the variant's total instance count. 
Required: No 
Type: CapacitySize 
Update requires: No interruption
Type 
Traffic routing strategy type. 
+  ALL_AT_ONCE: Endpoint traffic shifts to the new fleet in a single step. 
+  CANARY: Endpoint traffic shifts to the new fleet in two steps. The first step is the canary, which is a small portion of the traffic. The second step is the remainder of the traffic. 
+  LINEAR: Endpoint traffic shifts to the new fleet in n steps of a configurable size. 
Required: Yes 
Type: String 
Allowed values: ALL_AT_ONCE | CANARY | LINEAR 
Update requires: No interruption
WaitIntervalInSeconds 
The waiting time (in seconds) between incremental steps to turn on traffic on the new endpoint fleet. 
Required: No 
Type: Integer 
Minimum: 0 
Maximum: 3600 
Update requires: No interruption
