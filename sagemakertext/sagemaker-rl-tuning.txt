Hyperparameter Tuning with Amazon SageMaker RL
You can run a hyperparameter tuning job to optimize hyperparameters for Amazon SageMaker RL. The Roboschool example in the sample notebooks in the SageMaker examples repository shows how you can do this with RL Coach. The launcher script shows how you can abstract parameters from the Coach preset file and optimize them.
